* Author(s) : Abdelkrim Bensaïd;
* Download [stable version][1].


# Presentation #

This add-on allows to update the compatibility of the installed add-ons from a chosen year with newer versions of NVDA.

It updates the value of the "lastTestedNVDAVersion" key in add-on manifest files.

The year to choose can be selected from an item in NVDA's Tools menu.

## Important ##

Before using this add-on, please make sure that the add-ons you update are compatible with the year you choose, by consulting their authors.

That because it is possible that new routines are used in the updated version, or that some old ones are deprecated or not supported.

## Compatibility ##

* This addon has been tested with versions of NVDA ranging from 2019.1 up to 2023.1.
